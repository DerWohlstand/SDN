2.	OFNet SDN network emulator

Step 1:
1)	Take Three Switches of 2960 and name them as S1, S2 and S3.
2)	Take 3 Machine and name them as PC-1 and PC-2 and PC-3.
Step 2:
1)	Now Connect S2 to S1 with Fast Ethernet 0/1 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
2)	Now Connect S2 to S3 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
3)	Now Connect S2 to PC-2 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
4)	Now Connect S3 to PC-3 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
5)	Now Connect S1 to PC-1 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
Step 3:
1)	Click On S1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.                      
2)	Click On S2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it    
3)	Click On S3 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.     
4)	Click On PC-1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.     
5)	Click On PC-2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it. 
6)	Click On PC-3 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
