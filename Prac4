Practical 4
1.	Implement GRE Tunnel 
2.	Implement VTP 
3.	Implement NAT 

4.1. Implement GRE Tunnel
Step 1:
1)	Take Three Router of 1841 and name them as R1, R2 and R3.
2)	Take Two Switches of 2960 and give name S1 and S2.
3)	Take 4 Machine and name them as PC-1 and PC-2 and PC-3 andPC-4.
Step 2:
1)	Now Connect R1 to R2 with Fast Ethernet 0/1 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
2)	Now Connect R2 to S1 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
3)	Now Connect S1 to PC-1 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
4)	Now Connect S1 to PC-2 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1. 
5)	Now Connect R1 to R3 with Fast Ethernet 0/1 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
6)	Now Connect S2 to PC-3 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
7)	Now Connect S2 to PC-4 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
Step 3:
1)	Click On R1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
2)	Same step goes for R2 and R3.
3)	Click On S1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
4)	Same step goes for S2.
5)	Click On PC-1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
6)	Same step goes for PC-2 and PC-3 and PC-4.

4.2. Implement VTP 
Step 1:
1)	Take 4 Switches of 2960 and name them S1, S2, S3 and S4.
Step 2:
1)	Now Connect S1 to S2 with Fast Ethernet 0/1 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
2)	Now Connect S1 to S3 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
3)	Now Connect S3 to S4 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
Step 3:
1)	Click On S1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
2)	Click On S2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
3)	Click On S3 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
4)	Click On S4 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.

4.3.Implement NAT 
Step 1:
1)	Take 2 Routers 1841 and name them as R1 and R2.
2)	Take 2 Switches of 2960 and give name S1 and S2.
3)	Take 4 Machine and name them as PC-1 and PC-2.
4)	Take Server and name them as Server1.

Step 2:
1)	Now Connect R1 to R2 with Fast Ethernet 0/1 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
2)	Now Connect R1 to S1 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
3)	Now Connect S1 to PC-1 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
4)	Now Connect S1 to PC-2 with Fast Ethernet 0/3 to Fast Ethernet 0/1. 
5)	Now Connect S2 to Server1 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1.
    Step 3:
1)	1.Click On R1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.         
2)	2.Click On R2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP                  Address and Subnet mask to it.   
3)	3.Click On S1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
4)	4.Click On S2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.   
5)	5.Click On PC-1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP   Address it.  
6)	Click On PC-2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
