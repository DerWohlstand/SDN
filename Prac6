3)	And last take 2 Machines and give name PC-A and PC-B to them.
Step 2: 
1)	Now connect router R1 to switch S1 with Fast Ethernet fa0/0 cable to Fast Ethernet f0/1 cable.
2)	Now connect switch S1 to switch S2 with Fast Ethernet fa0/2 cable to Fast Ethernet f0/1 cable.
3)	Now connect switch S1 to PC-A with Fast Ethernet fa0/3 cable to Fast Ethernet fa0 cable.
4)	Now connect switch S2 to PC-B with Fast Ethernet fa0/2 cable to Fast Ethernet fa0 cable.
Step 3:
1)	Now click on device PC-A, go to Desktop click on IP Config and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it. 
2)	Now click on device PC-B, go to Desktop click on IP Config and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.  
Step 4:  Click on switch S1 and go to CLI commands and Configure the switch S1 and add IP Address and subnet mask to it.
Step 5:  Click on switch S2 and go to CLI commands and Configure the switch S2 and add IP Address and subnet mask to it.
