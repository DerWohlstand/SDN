PRACTICAL 6
Observe STP Topology Changes and Implement RSTP
1. Implement Advanced STP Modifications and Mechanisms
2. Implement MST
Step to Perform:
Step 1: (Requirement)
1)	Take 2 Multiport Switch of 3650 name them as D1 and D2.
2)	Then take 1 normal Switch of 2960 and name it as A1.
Step 2:
1)	Now connect D1 to D2 with Giga Ethernet 1/0/1 to Giga Ethernet 1/0/1 cable.
2)	Now connect D1 to A1 with Giga Ethernet 1/0/5 to Fast Ethernet 0/1 cable.
3)	Once Again make same connection between D1 to A1 just for backup with Giga Ethernet 1/0/6 to Fast Ethernet 0/2.
Step 3:
1)	Now connect D2 to A1 with Giga Ethernet 1/0/5 to Fast Ethernet 0/3 cable.
2)	Once Again make same connection between D2 to A1 just for backup with Giga Ethernet 1/0/6 to Fast Ethernet 0/4.
Step 4: 
1)	Now Double click on D1, go to the physical and there you will find Power Switch Just Drag that switch in Physical Device and close window. 
2)	Now Double click on D2, go to the physical and there you will find Power Switch Just Drag that switch in Physical Device and close window.
Step 5: Click on D1 and go to the CLI command and Configure and add IP Address to the multiport switch D1.
Step 6: Click on D2 and go to the CLI command and Configure and add IP Address to the multiport switch D2. 
Step 7: Click on A1 and go to the CLI command and Configure and add IP Address to the switch A1.
