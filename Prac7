Practical 7
1. Implement Ether Channel
2. Tune and Optimize Ether Channel Operations

Step 1: (Requirement)
 Take 3 Switches of 2960 and name it as S1, S2 and S3.
Step 2:  Configure the basic Switch setting.
1)	Now connect switch S1 to S2 with Giga Ethernet 0/1 to Giga Ethernet 0/1 cable.
2)	Once again Connect switch S1 to S2 with Giga Ethernet 0/2 to Giga Ethernet 0/2 cable.
3)	Then Connect S1 to S3 with Fast Ethernet 0/21 to Fast Ethernet 0/21 cable.
4)	Once again Connect S1 to S2 with Fast Ethernet 0/22 to Fast Ethernet 0/22 cable.
5)	Then Connect S2 to S3 with Fast Ethernet 0/23 to Fast Ethernet 0/23 cable.
6)	Once again Connect S2 to S3 with Fast Ethernet 0/24 to Fast Ethernet 0/24 cable.
  Step 3:
1)	Click on S1 and go to CLI command and Configure the Switch S1.
2)	Similarly Configure the Switch S2 and Switch S3.
