OSPF Implementation
1. Implement Single-Area OSPFv2.
2. Implement Multi-Area OSPFv2.
3. OSPFv2 Route Summarization and Filtering. 
4. Implement Multiarea OSPFv3.

8.1. Implement Single-Area OSPFv2.
Step 1:
1)	Take 2 routers of 1841 and give name R1 and R2.
2)	Take 2 switches of 2960 and give name as s1 and s2.
Step 2:
1)	now connect R1 to S1 with Fast Ethernet 0/0 to Fast Ethernet 0/0.
2)	 now connect S1 to S2 with Fast Ethernet 0/1 to Fast Ethernet 0/0.
3)	now connect S2 to R2 with Fast Ethernet 0/1 to Fast Ethernet 0/0.
Step 3:
1)	Click on R1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
2)	Click on R2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
3)	Click on S1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
4)	Click on S2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.


8.2. Implement Multi-Area OSPFv2.
Step 1:
1)	Take 3 routers of 1841 and give name R1, R2 and R3.
Step 2:
1)	now connect R1 to R2 with Fast Ethernet 0/0 to Fast Ethernet 0/0.
2)	now connect R1 to R3 with Fast Ethernet 0/01to Fast Ethernet 0/0.

Step 3:
1)	Click On R1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
2)	Click On R2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
3)	Click On R3 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.


8.3. OSPFv2 Route Summarization and Filtering. 
Step 1:
1)	Take 3 routers of 1841 and give name R1, R2 and R3.
Step 2:
1)	now connect R1 to R2 with Fast Ethernet 0/0 to Fast Ethernet 0/0.
2)	now connect R1 to R3 with Fast Ethernet 0/01to Fast Ethernet 0/0.
3)	now connect R2 to R32with serial cable 0/ 0/1 to serial cable 0/0/1.
4)	now connect R2 to R32with serial cable 0/ 0/2 to serial cable 0/0/2.
 Step 3:
1)	Click On R1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
2)	Click On R2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
3)	1. Click On R3 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.


8.4. Implement Multiarea OSPFv3.
Step 1: 
1)	1.Take 3 routers of 1841 and give name R1, R2 and R3.
2)	2.Take 1 server and give name server1.
Step 2: 
1)	Now connect R1 to R2 with Fast Ethernet 0/0 to Fast Ethernet 0/0.
2)	Then now connect R1 to R3 with Fast Ethernet 0/1to Fast Ethernet 0/0.
3)	Then connect R3 to server1 with Fast Ethernet 0/1to Fast Ethernet 0/0.

Step 3:
1)	Click On R1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
2)	Click On R2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
3)	Click On R3 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.

Step 4:
1)	Click on server1 go to Config and add IPv6 Address and gateway.
