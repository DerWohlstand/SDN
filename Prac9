1.	Implement MP-BGP
Step 1:
1)	Take Three Router of 1841 and name them as R1, R2 and R3. 
Step 2:
1)	Now Connect R2 to R1 with Fast Ethernet 0/1 to Fast Ethernet 0/1 cable.
2)	Now Connect R2 to R3 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/1 cable.
3)	Now Connect R1 to R3 with Serial Cable 0/0/1 to Serial Cable 0/0/1.
4)	Now Connect R1 to R3 with Serial Cable 0/0/2 to Serial Cable 0/0/2.
Step 3: 
1)	Click On R1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.                                              
2)	Click On R2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.   
3)	Click On S1 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.  
4)	Click On S2 and go to CLI command and configure and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it.
